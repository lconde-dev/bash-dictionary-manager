# 🐚 Bash Dictionary Manager

An automated command-line tool built with **Bash** for managing dictionaries and user records. This project focuses on text stream processing, file manipulation, and Linux automation techniques.

## 🛠️ Key Functionalities

- **User Management:** Secure authentication system with login/password verification and new user registration.
- **Advanced Filtering:** Query the dictionary based on specific criteria:
  - Starting/Ending letters.
  - Substring containment.
  - Vocal-based filtering.
- **Data Analytics:** Automatically calculates dictionary statistics (percentage of valid words, total word count) and exports them to a report.
- **Mathematical Algorithms:** Includes implementations for calculating averages/min-max values and palindrome (capicúa) verification.

## 💻 Technical Stack

- **Shell:** Bash (Bourne Again SHell).
- **Text Processing Tools:** `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, `IFS` for line parsing.
- **Concepts:** Control structures (while, case, for), ANSI color codes for UI, and file I/O redirection.
